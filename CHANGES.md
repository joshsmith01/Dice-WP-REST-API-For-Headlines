#### [unreleased]

#### 1.2.5
* Found and fixed bug that would correctly find the Headline category name, even though the headline name was not a parameter of `get_posts()`.
 
#### 1.3.0
Add feature to lock sortable list item into place...with a caveat. While the individual list item can't be selected for sorting, adjacent list items can be. Adjacent list items can *steal* the locked items position. 
 
Also added in this version, are UI enhancements to indicate that a post is actually locked.
   
#### 1.3.1
Remove the option to select images from a dropdown in the Headlines Meta box.

#### 1.3.2
Added the ability for users to add specific tracking codes to individual posts.
